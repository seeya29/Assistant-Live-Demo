Humility: Building this demo reminded me that simple, reliable systems matter more than perfect abstractions. I trimmed features to ship a clear, runnable pipeline and learned from each round of feedback.

Gratitude: Thanks for the crisp acceptance criteria and concrete contracts. They guided design decisions and kept the focus on user-visible valueâ€”summaries, tasks, and feedback that you can verify end-to-end.

Honesty: Some heuristics are intentionally lightweight (e.g., scheduling inference). They are correct enough for a demo and easy to replace with stronger NLP later. The code favors clarity and testability so future improvements are straightforward.
